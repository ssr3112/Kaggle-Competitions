This project predicts personality types from text using NLP and machine learning. The pipeline cleans and preprocesses text, extracts TF-IDF features, and trains multiple models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost. The repository includes preprocessing scripts, model training code, and a prediction file generator to create a Kaggle-ready submission.csv. Future improvements include BERT-based models and Streamlit deployment
