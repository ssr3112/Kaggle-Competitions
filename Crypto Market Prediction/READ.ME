Goal-To develop a model capable of predicting crypto market price movements using our production data. Accurate directional signals derived through quantitative methods can significantly enhance our trading strategies and enable more precise market opportunity identification.

# Tips
The training dataset covers the period from March 1, 2023, to February 29, 2024. The test data comes after the training period, though its timestamps are masked. Since data relevance matters, you don’t have to use the entire training set—feel free to focus on a specific window, such as only the most recent months, if that works better for your model.
