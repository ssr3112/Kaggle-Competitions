🎧 Podcast Listening Time Prediction

Kaggle Playground Series – Regression (RMSE)

📌 Overview

This repository contains my complete workflow for predicting Podcast Listening Time (in minutes) using machine learning.
The competition provides train and test datasets with podcast metadata, and the goal is to build a model that minimizes RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

This project includes:
